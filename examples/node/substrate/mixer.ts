  // The Webb.js note generation process allows for a variety of configurable parameters.
  // This example will relate these parameters to the substrate mixer context.
  //
  // The application environment will define the values for note input parameters.
  // These note inputs allow for metadata to be attached to the note, which helps to:
  //   (1) Identify which deposit is controlled by the note.
  //   (2) Identify how a note should be generated.
  //   (3) Auxiliary information that could be useful to know about a deposit.
  //
  // Some important parameters and example usage:
  //
  //  (1)
  //    - targetChain: Parameter to determine the chain for a deposit.
  //        - Our DApp maps substrate chains to our defined 'InternalChainId'. Applications are free
  //          to determine some custom identification.
  //    - targetIdentifyingData: Parameter to determine the location of a deposit on a chain.
  //        - In substrate, the mixer instance has an associated merkle tree. This merkle tree
  //          has an identifier. Our DApp populates this identifier in this field.

  //  (2)
  //    - backend:
  //        - Our substrate mixer pallets use 'Arkworks' as a backend. But other deployments (i.e. EVM)
  //          have 'Circom' as a backend.
  //    - hashFunction:
  //        - Our substrate mixer pallets use 'Poseidon' as a hash function. But other deployments (i.e. EVM)
  //          have 'Pederson' as a backend.
  //    - curve:
  //        - Our substrate mixer pallets use 'Bn254' for their curve.
  //    - width:
  //        - Related to the amount of secret parameters hashed together. Substrate mixer pallets assume the leaf
  //          was created with hash(chainID, nullifier, secret).
